# Pull Request Guidelines

Before opening a pull request to merge a feature branch into `develop` or `main`, please complete these steps:

1. **Verify Local Build**:
   Confirm the project builds without errors:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Review Code Hygene**:
   - Ensure there are no active console logging commands (`console.log`) or debug breakpoints left in presentation components.
   - Verify that credentials, passwords, or session tokens are not checked into the repository.
   - Confirm that no files reference placeholder APIs or retired local API servers.
3. **No Garbage Files**:
   Ensure git-ignored directories (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.idea/`, `.DS_Store`) are not committed.
